# WebKivanc Chatroom

### Basic Instructions:
- After you log in, you can either send messages in Lobby (the generic group), or choose to create your own group.
- You can also send private messages to a person in the group! Just click on the user's name to open a private chat between you and the other user. Your private chat will appear under groups.

### What we did for Creative Portion
  - When you create a group, the creator of the group is the admin  by default. We added functionality that allows the admin of a group to give their admin rights to another person in that group.
